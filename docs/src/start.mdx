# Getting Started

## Normal Ellipsis

<Playground>
  <Ellipsis
    text="A high performance and customized ellipsis component for react. Support to custom ellipsis char, ellipsis html, end char filter, reflow callback, ...etc."
    maxLine="1"
  />
</Playground>

Normal ellipsis base on css property `-webkit-line-clamp`, best performance and support flexible ellipsis natively.

## Custom Ellipsis Char

<Playground>
  <Ellipsis
    text="A high performance and customized ellipsis component for react. Support to custom ellipsis char, ellipsis html, end char filter, reflow callback, ...etc."
    maxLine="1"
    ellipsisNode=" ...Read More"
  />
</Playground>

## Custom Ellipsis Node

<Playground>
  <Ellipsis
    text="A high performance and customized ellipsis component for react. Support to custom ellipsis char, ellipsis html, end char filter, reflow callback, ...etc."
    maxLine="1"
    ellipsisNode={<a href="/start#custom-ellipsis-node">...Read More</a>}
  />
</Playground>

## Flexible Ellipsis

Normal Ellipsis support flexible ellipsis default. Should open by yourself when use more feature if the browser support `ResizeObserver`.

> Why not use window resize event, which has better compatibility?
>
> Because it will waste performance.

<Playground>
  <Ellipsis
    text="A high performance and customized ellipsis component for react. Support to custom ellipsis char, ellipsis html, end char filter, reflow callback, ...etc."
    maxLine="1"
    ellipsisNode=" ...Read More"
    reflowOnResize={true}
  />
</Playground>

## Filter End Char

<Playground>
  <Ellipsis
    text="A high performance and customized ellipsis component for react. Support to custom ellipsis char, ellipsis html, end char filter, reflow callback, ...etc."
    maxLine="1"
    ellipsisNode=" ...Read More"
    endExcludes={[' ', ',', '.']}
    reflowOnResize={true}
  />
</Playground>

## Rich text

You can use rich text by setting `dangerouslyUseInnerHTML=true`.

Recommended to use maxHeight instead of maxLine when use rich text.
Some child element in rich text may have different line-height from container
which will lead to compute maxLine error.

> <p style="color: red;">Warning⚠️: make sure the text that you pass is safe absolutely, or you may been attacked by XSS.</p>

<Playground>
  <Ellipsis
    text="A <b>high performance</b> and <b>customized</b> ellipsis component for react. Support to custom ellipsis char, ellipsis html, end char filter, reflow callback, ...etc."
    maxHeight="30"
    dangerouslyUseInnerHTML={true}
    reflowOnResize={true}
  />
</Playground>
